     * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
     * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed.
     * All houses at this place are arranged in a circle.
     * That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one.
     * Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and
     * it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
     *
     * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house,
     * determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: [2,3,2]
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
     *              because they are adjacent houses.
     *
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: [1,2,3,1]
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
     *              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
